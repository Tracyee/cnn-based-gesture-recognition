# cnn-based-gesture-recognition
A pytorch implementation on hand gesture recognition.

This is inspired and forked by [Chinese-number-gestures-recognition](https://github.com/tz28/Chinese-number-gestures-recognition).

Instead of trained with tensorflow, pytorch is used as the DL framework. 

You may modify the network as much as you want and retrain the new network. You may also put your own test samples in the **test_pics** folder and run `test.py` to see the results.
